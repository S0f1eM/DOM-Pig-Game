Build with HTML/CSS/JS at my beginnings (2016 ~ 2017).

## Rules to play : 
* The game has 2 players and is played in rounds. 
* In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he whishes. 
* Each result get added to his current score.
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his current score gets added to his global score. 
* But, if the player rolls a 1 before he hold, all his current score gets lost. 
* After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.
